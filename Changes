Revision history for Test-Valgrind

1.13    2011-08-25 15:45 UTC
        + Fix : The session will now call the finish() method at the right time.
        + Fix : The README file is now properly UTF-8-encoded.
        + Tst : Test demangling of Z-encoded symbols.

1.12    2009-11-29 16:45 UTC
        + Doc : The front documentation in Test::Valgrind was improved.
        + Fix : Don't install Valgrind.so, as it's only used for testing.
        + Fix : "Non-portable hex number" warnings.
        + Fix : Old versions of valgrind could leave some Z-encoded symbols in
                the stack traces. We now make sure they're always decoded.

1.11    2009-10-08 20:55 UTC
        + Doc : Completion and improvements.
        + Fix : Work around Kwalitee test misfailures.
        + Upd : Freshen Makefile.PL.

1.10    2009-09-22 18:45 UTC
        + Chg : valgrind is no longer required to be installed before installing
                this module.
        + Chg : The parser logic that used to be located inside the tool was
                moved to a new Test::Valgrind::Parser hierarchy. The tool
                decides which parser should be used by implementing the
                "parser_class" method.
        + Fix : Compatibility with valgrind 3.5.
        + Fix : The "valgrind" option to Test::Valgrind::Session->new wasn't
                doing anything.
        + Fix : The "Test" action could generate inappropriate error messages.

1.02    2009-05-02 12:05 UTC
        + Add : Commands can now be aggregated.
        + Add : The commands can now also filter and mangle reports.
        + Chg : The perl suppressions are now stripped from everything below
                Perl_runops_*.
        + Doc : Typos, nits and clarifications.

1.01    2009-04-14 21:15 UTC
        + Add : Allow testing code given by -e. Hurray for source filters!
        + Fix : Lazily load version.pm in Test::Valgrind::Session so that it's
                not really needed at configure time.
        + Fix : Don't unload dynamic extensions by default so that their symbols
                still appear in the stack traces.

1.00    2009-04-12 22:50 UTC
        Complete rewrite. The options passed to Test::Valgrind->import have
        changed, so please have a look at the doc.
        + Add : A brand new reusable API.
        + Add : Suppressions are now versionized following the perl interpreter
                and valgrind. They are regenerated as needed and stored in the
                user home directory.
        + Add : memcheck output is parsed by XML::Twig.
        + Add : The output of the original script is now correctly captured.
        + Rem : Lots of ugly hacks in the toolchain.

0.08    2009-02-08 18:25 UTC
        + Add : Unload the libraries loaded by DynaLoader at END time, reducing
                the number of leaks in perl.
        + Rem : The useless t/21-good-block.t.
        + Upd : META.yml spec updated to 1.4.

0.07    2008-09-30 13:35 UTC
        + Chg : Now conforms to the Test::Builder framework.
        + Fix : STDERR is longer eaten.
        + Fix : Eat STDOUT or print it as diagnostics, but never let him go
                through naked, as this may fiddle with the tests output.
        + Fix : 'make test' without prior 'make'.

0.06    2008-09-09 22:10 UTC
        + Fix : Suppressions were installed in the wrong path. Thanks Marvin
                Humphrey for reporting this.
        + Fix : Really load XSLoader when generating suppressions. Thanks Marvin
                Humphrey again for bringing this to my attention.
        + Fix : The logic for finding the file to run through valgrind was
                flawed, which lead to generate suppressions against
                Test/Valgrind.pm only.

0.051   2008-09-02 17:20 UTC
        + Fix : Forgot to upgrade version of the suppression placeholder module.

0.05    2008-08-25 22:05 UTC
        + Chg : Lower the default caller to 12.
        + Tst : Add a real-life test that gets executed only if you have a C
                compiler.

0.04    2008-05-13 16:25 UTC
        + Chg : Don't smoke this on 5.005 please.
        + Chg : Better way to find the valgrind executable.

0.03    2008-04-21 15:35 UTC
        + Fix : Include the mock Suppressions.pm rather than an empty file.

0.02    2008-04-21 15:25 UTC
        + Add : Test::Valgrind now depends on Perl::Destruct::Level. This is
                needed for non-debugging perls because we can't set their
                level of memory cleanup correctness on exit with the
                PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL environment variable.
        + Add : Hardcode valgrind path into the new constant
                Test::Valgrind::Suppressions::VG_PATH.
        + Chg : Test::Valgrind::Suppressions::supppath() is now supp_path().
        + Chg : lib/Test/Valgrind/Suppressions.pm.tpl was renamed to
                lib/Test/Valgrind/Suppressions.tpl for file portability reasons.

0.01    2008-04-19 15:50 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
