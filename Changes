Revision history for Test-Valgrind

0.07    2008-09-30 13:35 UTC
        + Chg : Now conforms to the Test::Builder framework.
        + Fix : STDERR is longer eaten.
        + Fix : Eat STDOUT or print it as diagnostics, but never let him go
                through naked, as this may fiddle with the tests output.
        + Fix : 'make test' without prior 'make'.

        + Fix : Suppressions were installed in the wrong path. Thanks Marvin
                Humphrey for reporting this.
        + Fix : Really load XSLoader when generating suppressions. Thanks Marvin
                Humphrey again for bringing this to my attention.
        + Fix : The logic for finding the file to run through valgrind was
                flawed, which lead to generate suppressions against
                Test/Valgrind.pm only.

0.051   2008-09-02 17:20 UTC
        + Fix : Forgot to upgrade version of the suppression placeholder module.

0.05    2008-08-25 22:05 UTC
        + Chg : Lower the default caller to 12.
        + Tst : Add a real-life test that gets executed only if you have a C
                compiler.

0.04    2008-05-13 16:25 UTC
        + Chg : Don't smoke this on 5.005 please.
        + Chg : Better way to find the valgrind executable.

0.03    2008-04-21 15:35 UTC
        + Fix : Include the mock Suppressions.pm rather than an empty file.

0.02    2008-04-21 15:25 UTC
        + Add : Test::Valgrind now depends on Perl::Destruct::Level. This is
                needed for non-debugging perls because we can't set their
                level of memory cleanup correctness on exit with the
                PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL environment variable.
        + Add : Hardcode valgrind path into the new constant
                Test::Valgrind::Suppressions::VG_PATH.
        + Chg : Test::Valgrind::Suppressions::supppath() is now supp_path().
        + Chg : lib/Test/Valgrind/Suppressions.pm.tpl was renamed to
                lib/Test/Valgrind/Suppressions.tpl for file portability reasons.

0.01    2008-04-19 15:50 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
