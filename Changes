Revision history for Test-Valgrind

0.02    2008-04-21 15:25 UTC
        + Add : Test::Valgrind now depends on Perl::Destruct::Level. This is
                needed for non-debugging perls because we can't set their
                level of memory cleanup correctness on exit with the
                PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL environment variable.
        + Add : Hardcode valgrind path into the new constant
                Test::Valgrind::Suppressions::VG_PATH.
        + Chg : Test::Valgrind::Suppressions::supppath() is now supp_path().
        + Chg : lib/Test/Valgrind/Suppressions.pm.tpl was renamed to
                lib/Test/Valgrind/Suppressions.tpl for file portability reasons.
