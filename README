NAME
    Test::Valgrind - Test Perl code through valgrind.

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        eval 'use Test::Valgrind';
        plan skip_all => 'Test::Valgrind is required to test your distribution with valgrind' if $@;

        # Code to inspect for memory leaks/errors.

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you run some code through the valgrind memory debugger,
    to test it for memory errors and leaks. Just add "use Test::Valgrind" at
    the beginning of the code you want to test. Behind the hood,
    "Test::Valgrind::import" forks so that the child can basically "exec
    'valgrind', $^X, $0" (except that of course $0 isn't right there). The
    parent then parses the report output by valgrind and pass or fail tests
    accordingly.

    You can also use it from the command-line to test a given script :

        perl -MTest::Valgrind leaky.pl

CONFIGURATION
    You can pass parameters to "import" as a list of key / value pairs,
    where valid keys are :

    "supp => $file"
        Also use suppressions from $file besides perl's.

    "no_supp => $bool"
        If true, do not use any suppressions.

    "callers => $number"
        Specify the maximum stack depth studied when valgrind encounters an
        error. Raising this number improves granularity. Default is 50.

    "extra => [ @args ]"
        Add @args to valgrind parameters.

    "diag => $bool"
        If true, print the raw output of valgrind as diagnostics (may be
        quite verbose).

    "no_test => $bool"
        If true, do not actually output the plan and the tests results.

CAVEATS
    You can't use this module to test code given by the "-e" command-line
    switch.

    Results will most likely be better if your perl is built with debugging
    enabled. Using the latest valgrind available will also help.

    This module is not really secure. It's definitely not taint safe. That
    shouldn't be a problem for test files.

    If your tests output to STDERR, everything will be eaten in the process.
    In particular, running this module against test files will obliterate
    their original test results.

DEPENDENCIES
    Valgrind 3.1.0 (<http://valgrind.org>).

    Carp, POSIX (core modules since perl 5) and Test::More (since 5.6.2).

    Perl::Destruct::Level.
