NAME
    Test::Valgrind - Test your code through valgrind.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        eval 'use Test::Valgrind';
        plan skip_all => 'Test::Valgrind is required to test your distribution with valgrind';

        # Code to inspect for memory leaks/errors.

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you run some code through the valgrind memory debugger,
    to test it for memory errors and leaks. Just add "use Test::Valgrind" at
    the beginning of the code you want to test. Behind the hood,
    "Test::Valgrind::import" forks so that the child can basically "exec
    'valgrind', $^X, $0" (except that of course $0 isn't right there). The
    parent then parses the report output by valgrind and pass or fail tests
    accordingly.

CONFIGURATION
    You can pass parameters to "import" as a list of key / value pairs,
    where valid keys are :

    "supp => $file"
        Also use suppressions from $file besides perl's.

    "no_supp => $bool"
        If true, do not use any suppressions.

    "callers => $number"
        Specify the maximum stack depth studied when valgrind encounters an
        error. Raising this number improves granularity. Default is 50.

    "extra => [ @args ]"
        Add @args to valgrind parameters.

    "diag => $bool"
        If true, print the raw output of valgrind as diagnostics (may be
        quite verbose).

    "no_test => $bool"
        If true, do not actually output the plan and the tests results.

CAVEATS
    You can't use this module to test code given by the "-e" command-line
    switch. This module is not really secure. It's definitely not taint
    safe. That shouldn't be a problem for test files. If your tests output
    to STDERR, everything will be eaten in the process.

DEPENDENCIES
    Valgrind 3.1.0 (<http://valgrind.org>).

    Carp, POSIX (core modules since perl 5) and Test::More (since 5.6.2).
