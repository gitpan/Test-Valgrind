=head1 NAME

Test::Valgrind::Command::PerlScript - A Test::Valgrind command that invokes a perl script.

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.13

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.13';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is meant to abstract the argument list handling of a C<perl> script.

=cut

use base qw<Test::Valgrind::Command::Perl Test::Valgrind::Carp>;

=head1 METHODS

This class inherits L<Test::Valgrind::Command::Perl>.

=head2 C<< new file => $file, [ taint_mode => $taint_mode ], ... >>

The package constructor, which takes several options :

=over 4

=item *

C<$file> is the path to the C<perl> script you want to run.

This option is mandatory.

=item *

C<$taint_mode> is actually handled by the parent class L<Test::Valgrind::Command::Perl>, but it gets special handling in this subclass : if C<undef> is passed (which is the default), the constructor will try to infer its right value from the shebang line of the script.

=back

Other arguments are passed straight to C<< Test::Valgrind::Command::Perl->new >>.

 my $class = shift;
 $class = ref($class) || $class;

 my $taint_mode = delete $args{taint_mode};
 if (not defined $taint_mode and open my $fh, '<', $file) {
  my $first = <$fh>;
  close $fh;
  if ($first and my ($args) = $first =~ /^\s*#\s*!\s*perl\s*(.*)/) {
   $taint_mode = 1 if $args =~ /(?:^|\s)-T(?:$|\s)/;
  }
  $taint_mode = 0 unless defined $taint_mode;
 }

 my $self = bless $class->SUPER::new(
  taint_mode => $taint_mode,
  %args,
 ), $class;

 $self->{file} = $file;

 return $self;
}

sub new_trainer { Test::Valgrind::Command::Perl->new_trainer }

=head2 C<file>
